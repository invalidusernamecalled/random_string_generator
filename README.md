random.bat /4


cLocking 690 strings per minute the pseudorandom.bat can serve
your high need (low cost) project. this batch script requires
bonniewala.bat to run as a service (ongoing in background)
and keygenerator.bat needs be present in the working directory.
this key changer can mess up the brute-force dreams of any
schmucck arse in this world. *clap for yourself*
